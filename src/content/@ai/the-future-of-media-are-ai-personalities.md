Notes:
* Ai Personalities will become more or just as important as Ai Technology itself.
* In the future companies will have digital mascots and their personalities, i.e, the sound of their voices, their demeanor, writing style, speaking style, character, etc will be critical to brand development. 
* Already we ChatGPT and other powerful LLM's being used to generate books, musical albums, and art.
* Less frequently we have already started to see the beginning of Ai generated video and animations. 
* A combination of multiple Ai generation capabilities have been used to create Ai Newscasters who are animated to given artificial voices to communicate ai generated messages about a news topic. 
* This is all the beginning of what will ultimately be a radical shift in how media is generated and sold to the public.
* Currently people are lamenting the flood of Ai spam and I suspect that will continue, but over time I do think people will not reject a piece of content simply because it came from an Ai. I think if the content is of high quality and produces meaningful results for the consumer then they will but into it. Lets take Ai Books, in the future it is totaly resonable to expect books produce and shelved with completed Ai Personalities & Avatars presented as the author. Writing tools may even become sophisticated enough to enable the development of the Ai's writing style, enabling designers to tweak the personality and writing style to fit the expectations of the reader. And you can have many books written in this style and an entire social presence assocated with the avatar.

* Ai Avatars in th e Adult Entertainment space - 
* I can see a future where people lament the generation of Ai content as a flood of bot spam but those who can use sophisticated prompting techniques in conjunction with powerful LLM's to combine multiple generative senses into a complete package will find enormouse success. 
* At current, there is a significant amount of people who fear the rise of Ai and it's potential impact on jobs, creativity, and human identity. Many of them work in fields where Ai is challenging how they wwwork in new ways. Some are adapting, using the Ai tools to become more efficient where they can and others are rebelling against the technology together. The state of things, reminds me of a 2014 Lance Armstrong quote when Oprah asked him if he 'felt bad' about cheating, Armstrong responded: "The definition of cheat is to gain an advantage over a rival or foe. I didn't do that. I viewed it as a ***level playing field***". I imagine those who rebel against the technology today will find themselves as Lance Armstrong did in 2014 using Ai not to get ahead, as the time will have passed, but to simply match up and level the playing field. 



The future of media will see Ai Personalities integrated in every aspect of the industry. Initially, we will see
