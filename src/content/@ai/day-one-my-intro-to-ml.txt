Welcome to the [Ai Journal](https://www.esy.com/@ai),

Yesterday, I discussed my intent behind this journal, which is to record my non-linear approach and journey for studying Ai/ML. I picked up five books that I intend to complete by years end.

### The list:
- The Kaggle Book
- Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn
- Hands-on ML w/ Scikit-Learn, Keras, & Tensorflow
- Mathematics for Machine Learning
- Deep Learning for Coders w/ FastAi & PyTorch

There is a great deal of video content online as well but to be honest, I'm not likely to do well there. I noticed in my years of studying fullstack web development that I do best by reading books, blogs, tutorials where I can go at my own pace. I haven't been prescribed but I tend to demonstrate some of the behavior known in individuals with ADHD. I've also been known to daydream since I was like 9, I'm 34.

One question might come to mind, will I complete this list? I don't know but I will drop a daily journal of what I studied each day, no matter what. As I said in the previous journal, I don't even know if I'll still like the idea of ML after studying it, but I feel it deserves at least 6 months of rigorous study, this way I'll know if I am simply romancing the idea of being proficient in it versus actually enjoying the day to day grind of doing it. I think a lot of people 'learning how to code' today have this problem, they don't really love it, but it's now cool and pays to be a tech nerd.
