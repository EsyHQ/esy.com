I've been having a blast lately, you know, the kind where you stay up all night for hours obsessing over a brand new toy and it's all due to MidJourney, a state-of-the-art, proprietary text-to-image algorithm. If you're wondering what I'm talking about, simply check out these AI-generated art pieces "that I created" or rather that I prompted into existence. Disclaimer, "I stole the baby one", well kind of, it was generated in a public forum and I prompted the algorithm to create a similar version of it using a different seed (random alphanumeric characters used to generate unique variations of art), so technically I didn't REALLY steal it.
