Who are Asians?
Note how some Americans of European descent often complain about the usage of African American, pushing Americans of African Descent to adopt the terminology of 'Black',
a color to narrowly describe the 'type of American' they are. However, no one seems to have an issue when
the multi-generational American of Asian descent identifies as Asian American. No one tells this individual that
they are not Asian, nor do they reference random Whites that have been born in Asia as being more Asian. However, we see particulary in the case of Elon Musk, this narrative 
spread that Elon Musk is more African American than the American of African Descent. The logic is used to undermine the American of African Descent's heritage and linkage to 
their ancestral land. 

In America, the term Asian is usually in reference to East or South East Asians (e.g, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Thai, Myanmar, etc), Indians are referred to as South Asian and others will identify as Asian,
however, generally speaking it is the Eastern appearence that one assumes when using the term. 


It would be twisted to reduce the Chinese American to the derogatory term 'Yellow', or even to group all Asians into this term. 
Should the Japanese, far more pale in appearance than many Europeans, also identify as 'Yellow'? The Korean as well? And suppose we should 
refer to these nations with their own rich heritage and accomplishments as Yellow people. Not Asians, people native to Asian continent and not Korean Americans, where we
track their ancestral origin and nationality combined to humanize them but no 'that yellow guy', whatever that means.
