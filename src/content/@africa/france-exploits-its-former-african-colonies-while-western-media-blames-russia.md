Welcome to [The African Journal][TAJ],


I've noticed a trend in Western media and politics, most notably led by white-owned U.S media conglomerates, where the legitamate desires and will of the African people to govern their countries the way they see fit are often sidelined in an attempt to justify and promote Western influence in their countries. This sequence of events are not isolated to the African sphere but is often a pattern of the collective American and Western foreign policies in reporting on non-Western states. In the case of Niger, if you read the usual entities responsbile for shaping the world view on politics in Africa, that is, the Western media establishments youd come to the conclusion that Russia is Satanic, using it's Wagner group to exploit weak, impoverished and desperate Africans and China, it's equally malevolaent partner is coming in to colonize the continent through frivolous loan agreements that leave the nations in a debt-trap.  Usually, there is no legitamate evidence to suggest this is the foreign policy of Russia or China in Africa but it is a usual dark tactic competitors use to undermine their competition in growing markets or those where they hold an existing monopoly. That doesn't mean that Russia or China does not have self-interest in Africa, it also doesn't suggest that there may not be a case of exploitation. However, it is ironic, that the colonizers of Africa, and countries like France who continue to exploit it's former colinies  in Africa in full view of the EU, UN, and global society are never held to any scrutiny in the reporting. In American media particularly, you rarely find any detailed reporting by these mainstream networks regarding the details of how France exploits it's former colonies, influenced coups, etc. France reliance on Niger for at least 1/5 of it's Uranium and power needs yet Niger remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Even more troubling is the failure to empathize with the African, with the Nigerien while demanding that African empathize with Ukraine despite the historical and continuing exploitation of their continet by Ukraine and it's EU partners. And we won't even discuss the mistreatment that Africans face in Europe and most recently in Ukraine during wartime. Should Africans stop doing business with Russia and Wagner on behalf of their Western partners who arrogantly exploit them while pointing fingers at the East as if they don't have the intelligence to see who has been mistreating and robbing them? Then perhaps they should stop doing business with the West altogther on behalf of Libya, Western staged coups in their democracies, and the neocolonial exploitation and ambitions of Francophone nations by France. 

In such a case of misinformation backed by an obvious agenda, you have to stop and think, what am I missing? 

The African has to ask himself why the reporting in Western media is so blatantly uniform and why it doesn't contain

Use analogy of the man choosing firing squad over escaping to unknown - 
African suffers from stockholm syndrome, at some point, they ought do deeper research on this fact, that some Africans would rather continue to do business with those who have historically exploited them, this is known fact that the world is fully aware. That Africa has been exploited by the united Western powers, perhaps the only continent to be exploited so severely in terms of natural resources, large scale human trafficking, and human chattell slavery. It is notoriusly unprecedented in scale realtive to any case in human history and each country in Africa today has been impacted by this and suffers deeply to this day. Yet even then, the African will believe and trust those who orchestrated these atrocities over their new partners. Some will say, "I will not do business with China, as they may rob us!" while doing business with those who have exploited them and continue to exploit them. What sense is this? It's a remarkable line of though that is persistent on the continent. Does this mean the African should not conduct business with the West? We know that is impossible. However, the African should be judicious in his thinking, always considering the context of history and current events in how Westerners perceive him and conduct trade with those who look like him. It is obvious, that if he fails to do this he will be continue to be exploited.  -->
